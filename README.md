# London Bike Rides Visualization
This project is dedicated to analyzing and visualizing data on bike rides in London. Its aim is to identify patterns and trends in bike usage throughout the city, 
providing insights into user behaviour, peak riding times, and frequently travelled routes.

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of data related to bike rides in London. The primary objective is to identify patterns and trends in bike usage 
across different areas of the city. By examining this data, we aim to gain valuable insights into user behaviour, peak riding times, and the most frequently travelled routes. 
These findings can help improve urban planning, optimize bike-sharing systems, and enhance overall transportation efficiency for cyclists in London.

**Tableau Dashboard**  
This project includes an interactive Tableau dashboard designed to provide a comprehensive overview of bike rides in London. The dashboard features a range of data visualizations that allow users to explore and analyze biking trends, user behavior, and key metrics such as peak usage times and popular routes. By interacting with the visualizations, users can gain deeper insights into biking habits across different areas of the city, helping to better understand cycling patterns and inform decision-making related to urban mobility.

## Data Source
This analysis is based on multiple data files, including Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, and a Jupyter Notebook used for data processing. Additionally, the original dataset is provided in a compressed zip file, containing raw data that is cleaned and structured before analysis. These diverse data sources enable a thorough examination of bike ride patterns and trends in London.  

**Tools and Technologies**  
- **Tableau:** Utilized for developing interactive visualizations, allowing users to explore trends and insights effectively.  
- **Python:** Used within Jupyter Notebooks for data cleaning, transformation, and in-depth analysis, ensuring the dataset is properly structured for visualization.  
- **Excel:** Employed for preliminary data organization, formatting, and manipulation, facilitating easier integration with other tools.  

Together, these technologies contribute to a seamless workflow, from data preparation to insightful visual representation.

## Key Insights  

The analysis of the *london_bikes_final.xlsx* dataset has revealed several important trends and patterns in bike usage across London. These insights provide a deeper understanding of how factors such as time of day, day of the week, seasonality, holidays, and weather conditions influence biking habits in the city.  

- **Peak Usage Times:** The highest bike usage is observed during typical commuting hours, with a sharp increase at **8 AM** and another peak between **5â€“6 PM**, aligning with work and school travel patterns.  
- **Day of the Week Analysis:** Bike usage tends to be higher on weekdays compared to weekends, with **Thursday being the busiest day** of the week.  
- **Seasonal Trends:** Biking activity fluctuates throughout the year, with the **highest usage in summer**, followed by autumn and spring. **Winter experiences the lowest levels of bike usage**, likely due to colder temperatures and harsher weather conditions.  
- **Holiday Impact:** On public holidays, bike usage is **significantly lower** compared to regular weekdays, suggesting that a large portion of rides are commute-related.  
- **Weekend vs. Weekday Usage:** **Weekdays consistently see higher bike usage than weekends**, indicating that cycling is more commonly used for work or school-related travel rather than leisure during the weekends.  
- **Weather Influence:** Weather conditions play a crucial role in bike usage. The **highest number of rides occur under scattered clouds**, followed by broken clouds and clear weather. In contrast, **the lowest bike usage is recorded during snowfall**, demonstrating how adverse weather discourages cycling.  

These insights help in understanding biking behaviour and can assist city planners, policymakers, and transportation officials in optimizing cycling infrastructure, improving bike-sharing services, and promoting sustainable urban mobility.

**How to Use the Dashboard**  

The interactive Tableau dashboard is designed to help users explore and analyze bike usage trends across London. By leveraging various features and tools within the dashboard, users can gain valuable insights and interact with the data in a meaningful way. Below are the key functionalities to help you navigate and make the most of the dashboard:  

- **Navigation:** The dashboard consists of multiple views or tabs, each offering a different perspective on bike usage data. Users can switch between these tabs to explore various trends, such as peak usage times, seasonal patterns, and the impact of weather conditions on biking behaviour.  
- **Interacting with Charts:** The dashboard includes interactive charts and graphs that allow users to engage with the data. Clicking on specific elements, hovering over data points for additional details, or using sliders to adjust parameters enables a more dynamic exploration of the dataset.  
- **Filtering Data:** Users can refine their analysis by applying filters to focus on specific subsets of data. Filters allow for customization based on factors such as **date, time of day, weather conditions, or day of the week**, making it easier to identify targeted insights.  
- **Resetting Views:** After applying multiple filters, users can reset the dashboard to its original state with a single click. This feature ensures that fresh analyses can be conducted without previous selections influencing new insights.  
- **Exploring Data Points:** Where applicable, the dashboard offers drill-down capabilities, allowing users to access more granular details. By clicking on specific data points, users can uncover deeper layers of information, such as the breakdown of bike usage in different areas of the city or changes in riding behaviour over time.  

By utilizing these interactive features, users can efficiently analyze bike usage patterns and gain a deeper understanding of cycling trends in London, making data-driven decisions easier and more insightful.
